# CleanDataWeek4
Week4 Project

Run_Analysis performs a set of clean up and tidy operations to produce a new tidy output that contains a set of variable averages for each Participant/Activity combination.  

It requires setting the working directory and the dplyr library.  The directory is set within the function and the dplyr library is loaded inside the function.  

Inside the function, the original set of data is tidied up as well and can be outputted.
